# Text Encryptor API üîê
This API was developed with SpringBoot. I just want to let you know this was my first API and it was developed with all my effort by researching how to do an API on SpringBoot.

This is just a basical API where I tried to learn SpringBoot and I decided to implement into the API some algorithms that I did a long time ago for my homework
